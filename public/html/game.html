            Choose a player to go first. On your turn, move
            any of your checkers. Follow the movement rules described

        <h3>
            Movement Rules
        </h3>
        <li>
            Always move your checker diagonally
            <i>
                forward
            </i>
            , toward your opponent's side of the
            boardgame.
            <i>
                Note:
            </i>
            After a checker becomes a "King",
            he can move diagonally forward or backward.
        </li>
        <li>
            Move your checker one space diagonbally, to an
            open adjacent to the checker you jumped. When you jump
            over an oppenent's checker, you
            <i>
                capture
            </i>
            it (see
            <i>
                Capturing an Opponent's Checker
            </i>
            ).
        </li>
        <li>
            If all squares adjacent to your checker are
            occupied, your checker is blocked and cannot move.
        </li>
    </header>

        <h3>
            Capturing an Opponent's Checker
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you jump an opponent's checker, you capture it.
            Remove it from the gameboard and place it in front of
            you.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Becoming a "King"
        </h3>
        <p>
            As soon a one of your checkers reachers the first
            row on your ipponent's side of the gameboard, he becomes
            a King. Place another checker of the same color on top of
            it. Now this double-decker checker can move forward
            <i>
                or
            </i>
            backward on the gameboard.

            from the gameboard wins the game!
